       "      <td>A small, cozy family run Authentic korean restaurant.  Chris Lee - the owner is very friendly and courteous.  The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nOrdered a whole bunch of food to share including:\\n\\n1) Pork Bone Soup - $9.99\\n2) Samgyeopsal - BBQ Bacon and soup (for 2 ppl) - $32.99\\n3) &amp; 4)  Bibimbap - $??\\n5) Side dishes - Free\\n\\n\\n1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.  This is because of the potatoes in the soup and is really delicious.  It used to come with the Korean multigrain \\/ five grain rice (Ogokbap), but this time they served it with white rice.  When asked, Chris said that due to the raising cost, they are now serving with white rice - Generally not a good sign when they start to cut corners.\\n\\n2) I personally don't find anything special about this dish and find it a bit over priced.  They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork (uncured bacon).  You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste....A-OK, nothing really wowed me.  The combo also comes with a soup.  \\n\\n3) &amp; 4) Got two different Bibimbap, one was plain rice with beef, some veggies.  They give you hot sauce  and sesame oil to add.  The second one was kim - Chee Bibimbap.  Both of them  comes with fried egg and served in traditional stone bowl.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe they were about $12.99 for each.  Once again, a bit over priced, however it was good.\\n\\n5)  Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.  I particularly love their Kim Chi.  The only other place where I have seen\\/tasted this kind of kim chi is in Korea.  It's hard to explain, but this is as authentic as it's going to get.\\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.  The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.  The only complain is the price point seems to be a bit off, If it was 25% cheaper, This would be one of my regular spot.</td>\n",

Love that there is a gluten-free, vegan version of the cheese curds and gravy!!\\n\\nHaven't done the poutine taste test yet with smoke's but Im excited to see which is better. However poutini's might win as they are vegan and gluten-free   \n",

My friend wanted to come here for her birthday. We had a group of seven and based on the way the seating works (as it is communal), we wind up sharing with another group of five. \\n\\nFood was ok - not sure what the hype was. Almost 75% of the dishes had some sort of cheese in it.\\n\\nThis place is very loud so not ideal for catching up\\/talking. Not a great place to go if you have any gluten or vegan restrictions.\\n\\nInteresting concept. Would definitely recommend to try this place once - but definitely not worth the 30- 45 mins wait.   \n",

This place will take a long time to serve your food - as it took them almost an hour to give us our food. So make sure you give yourself lots of time! It is definitely a lazy brunch place!\\n\\nDefinitely recommend the pancakes! Beware of the portion sizes - they are huge!   \n",

Front desk girl is just interested in money (I guess), I feel like they over booked me and just opened a table in one of the room which had 3 chairs\\/couch (for foot massage).  Space was so tight the girl cannot even go around the table and had to push the table every time she wanted to come around (annoying noise).\\n\\nAt the end of the Massage, went back to front desk, handed over $40 and asked for $5 return and told the girl to give the masseuse the other $5.  She said 'oh'...and put the $5 in the drawer and went on doing whatever she was doing.\\n\\nP.S.  RMT receipt price: $70   \n",

       "5261666  A small, cozy family run Authentic korean restaurant.  Chris Lee - the owner is very friendly and courteous.  The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nOrdered a whole bunch of food to share including:\\n\\n1) Pork Bone Soup - $9.99\\n2) Samgyeopsal - BBQ Bacon and soup (for 2 ppl) - $32.99\\n3) & 4)  Bibimbap - $??\\n5) Side dishes - Free\\n\\n\\n1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.  This is because of the potatoes in the soup and is really delicious.  It used to come with the Korean multigrain \\/ five grain rice (Ogokbap), but this time they served it with white rice.  When asked, Chris said that due to the raising cost, they are now serving with white rice - Generally not a good sign when they start to cut corners.\\n\\n2) I personally don't find anything special about this dish and find it a bit over priced.  They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork (uncured bacon).  You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste....A-OK, nothing really wowed me.  The combo also comes with a soup.  \\n\\n3) & 4) Got two different Bibimbap, one was plain rice with beef, some veggies.  They give you hot sauce  and sesame oil to add.  The second one was kim - Chee Bibimbap.  Both of them  comes with fried egg and served in traditional stone bowl.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe they were about $12.99 for each.  Once again, a bit over priced, however it was good.\\n\\n5)  Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.  I particularly love their Kim Chi.  The only other place where I have seen\\/tasted this kind of kim chi is in Korea.  It's hard to explain, but this is as authentic as it's going to get.\\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.  The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.  The only complain is the price point seems to be a bit off, If it was 25% cheaper, This would be one of my regular spot.   \n",

The food was sub-keg and the service was definitely under par.\\n\\nWent with a group of people, after taking the initial order, our server seems to have disappeared.  We were missing some water and had to wave down another waiter to ask for our waiter.  Asked for the water, and once again he disappeared and no water.  Kindda annoying.\\n\\nSteak was unevenly cooked.  Asked for a medium well rib steak, half of my steak was medium and the other half was well......kindda gives a different meaning to medium well.  \\n\\nOne of the person in the group also found hair(s) in her food.  She opted not to eat after that, In all fairness the Manager came by to make sure if there wasn't anything he can do.  Since she was disgusted, she did not wanted a replacement.\\n\\nThe manager however offered us two pieces of cheese cake at no charge.\\n\\nAll in all, it was A-OK, the best part is the atmosphere, that's about it.   \n",

I've been to their Hwy 7 \\/ Kennedy location few times and the food was 'OK'.\\n\\nOnce I got to the restaurant I totally forgot what to order...lol.  Ended up getting:\\n\\n1) Big bowl soup\\n2) Noodles with spicy shredded pork\\n3) Spicy Chilly steamed fish\\n\\nI just made those names up...but they all have pictures.\\n\\n1)  Soup is the same as the other location, nothing to brag about, just very fresh and delicious.\\n\\n2)  Even though it was suppose to be spicy pork, it tasted sweet.  not spicy AT ALL.  it comes with a bowl of msg hot water (i think they call it soup).  Which the waiter spilled over the table and one of the chair.\\n\\n3)  Fish itself was good, but they used the flavorless chilies, no taste.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\n\\nThis place have one of the WORST service.  Went at 8:00pm on a wednesday, restataurant was 60% empty and they had 3 waiters that have a very unique skill of walking around without looking at you.  Sort of like AYCE Japanese restaurant.  Had to wait 15~20min before we could flag down a retarded fat ass lazy waiter.\\n\\nSince i don't speak cantonese, i was ordering in english and he would yell out loud the dish i wanted in Cantonese....in a signing tone...WTF???\\n\\nWhen he brought over the #2) dish, he spilled half of it on his hand, table and chair beside me...no big deal.  BUT ATLEAST CLEAN IT UP!!!.  When he brought over the #1) and #3) i asked him each time to clean that up, he just rolled his eyes.  I finally had to flag down ANOTHER WAITER (which was a challenge itself) to clean it up. \\n\\nAnyways, bill came up to $30ish+, left him $0.01 tips.\\n\\nP.S.

I asked him if I can make up my mind after I tried the gym out first, but he insisted I do it now or else the price will go up.  As a matter of fact, he has a price increase meeting tomorrow....hahaha\\n\\nDid not opt for the 'new' package, stuck with my original package.  He seemed upset...said fine, your membership expires in 4 months, you just get your membership and nothing else, you will have to pay for parking too.  I told him...but I see that there is a sign that says one hr free parking.  umm...err...ehhh...yeah, well, only one hr free, after that you will have to pay $3\\/hr.  whatever...\\n\\nAfter signing everything, he said you will get your access card after you finish your assessment (aka personal trainer sales pitch).

Called on a thursday, confirmed that the price of the buffet today dinner is $8.99, Weekend is $10.99.  Headed out...\\n\\nWhen we arrived, there was couple of dudes sitting at the bar and told us, they are closed today and is only open on Fri\\/Sat\\/Sun.

       "5261662  So after reading Precilla C. review, I decided to try this location.  I've been to their Hwy 7 \\/ Kennedy location few times and the food was 'OK'.\\n\\nOnce I got to the restaurant I totally forgot what to order...lol.  Ended up getting:\\n\\n1) Big bowl soup\\n2) Noodles with spicy shredded pork\\n3) Spicy Chilly steamed fish\\n\\nI just made those names up...but they all have pictures.\\n\\n1)  Soup is the same as the other location, nothing to brag about, just very fresh and delicious.\\n\\n2)  Even though it was suppose to be spicy pork, it tasted sweet.  not spicy AT ALL.  it comes with a bowl of msg hot water (i think they call it soup).  Which the waiter spilled over the table and one of the chair.\\n\\n3)  Fish itself was good, but they used the flavorless chilies, no taste.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\n\\nThis place have one of the WORST service.  Went at 8:00pm on a wednesday, restataurant was 60% empty and they had 3 waiters that have a very unique skill of walking around without looking at you.  Sort of like AYCE Japanese restaurant.  Had to wait 15~20min before we could flag down a retarded fat ass lazy waiter.\\n\\nSince i don't speak cantonese, i was ordering in english and he would yell out loud the dish i wanted in Cantonese....in a signing tone...WTF???\\n\\nWhen he brought over the #2) dish, he spilled half of it on his hand, table and chair beside me...no big deal.  BUT ATLEAST CLEAN IT UP!!!.  When he brought over the #1) and #3) i asked him each time to clean that up, he just rolled his eyes.  I finally had to flag down ANOTHER WAITER (which was a challenge itself) to clean it up. \\n\\nAnyways, bill came up to $30ish+, left him $0.01 tips.\\n\\nP.S.  The staff in Kennedy\\/Hwy 7 is MUCH friendlier   \n",

I asked him if I can make up my mind after I tried the gym out first, but he insisted I do it now or else the price will go up.  As a matter of fact, he has a price increase meeting tomorrow....hahaha\\n\\nDid not opt for the 'new' package, stuck with my original package.  He seemed upset...said fine, your membership expires in 4 months, you just get your membership and nothing else, you will have to pay for parking too.  I told him...but I see that there is a sign that says one hr free parking.  umm...err...ehhh...yeah, well, only one hr free, after that you will have to pay $3\\/hr.  whatever...\\n\\nAfter signing everything, he said you will get your access card after you finish your assessment (aka personal trainer sales pitch).  I told  him I do not need an assessment as I will only be using the treadmill.  He said I HAVE to get an assessment for insurance purpose....LAAAME!\\n\\nwill update after my physical assessment.   \n",
