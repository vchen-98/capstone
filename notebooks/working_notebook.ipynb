The juice was yummy and would definitely order it again! The shawarma - I'm not sure about it. The meat wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be.

I was well warned of the teasing that could easily be done to all the fantasy perfect waitresses, so this I was expecting (and somewhat looking forward to).\\n\\nI have to admit I wasn't all that impressed with the inside, but I did really enjoy the patio area. It was the perfect place to relax and people watch, which was most excellent that day in particular. The place settings were appreciated, as a lot of places do not offer a stone or cradle to rest your sticks on.. and hell, even my home set has cradles. I made sure of that. \\n\\nAlso, while the service was good... I think everyone set my expectations pretty high for the waitresses... I was unable to do any harassing. Sad face.\\n\\nOne suggestion if you go... try the green tea. Two reasons. First,  the cups are incredible. I love them. I am considering it a collect them all game and will try to make damn sure I do. Second, the tea is delicious. I had two amazing cups.\\n\\nThe sushi isn't all that bad either. It could've been just me, but I found the selection of sushi a little limited and the specialty ones pretty overpriced, but the sushi I had was out of this world. I had the spicy scallop and the summertime soy paper roll. I seriously gobbled down that summertime roll fast and impressed many. \\n\\nI'll probably be back if I crave sushi at lunchtime again. However, I really get disappointed at the prices of the ones I would like to try (especially for lunch) and think I may run out of new dishes to try soon.</td>\n",

Luckily, someone behind the counter sensed my frustration and helped me.\\n\\nThe prices weren't bad and everything was ready quickly and I was able to take a seat on a comfy chair in an area no one was occupying. The muffin was huge. Therefore, that combined with the smoothie rather than a lemonade meant I pretty much had my dinner there. Kinda sad. The muffin was fantastic but huge. The winner of this visit though? The black cherry smoothie. Now that I know how big portions are, whenever I need something to hold me over, I'll be back for that. Pure heaven.</td>\n",

I've found household items, cute chandeliers, and usually always get key covers there.. this past time it was unikeys :)\\n\\nI sometimes cry a bit that the clothing is a little more mainstream than the other items, but I typically find a few basic pieces I should grab. \\n\\nOne awesome upside is the bags are durable and the straps long enough you can put the bag over your shoulder like a tote.. and the inside is bright pink.\\n\\nDownfall is shoes are way too expensive there... I hate paying so much for things that just walk on the ground. Gross.\\n\\nNot enough good deals or original clothing to go back frequently but I do love to window shop there and occasionally come out with a gem.   \n",
       "811  Continuing in the week of lunch, I ventured out the other day to Stingray. A coworker and I were craving some sushi, and they love Stingray, so I decided to give it a whirl. I was well warned of the teasing that could easily be done to all the fantasy perfect waitresses, so this I was expecting (and somewhat looking forward to).\\n\\nI have to admit I wasn't all that impressed with the inside, but I did really enjoy the patio area. It was the perfect place to relax and people watch, which was most excellent that day in particular. The place settings were appreciated, as a lot of places do not offer a stone or cradle to rest your sticks on.. and hell, even my home set has cradles. I made sure of that. \\n\\nAlso, while the service was good... I think everyone set my expectations pretty high for the waitresses... I was unable to do any harassing. Sad face.\\n\\nOne suggestion if you go... try the green tea. Two reasons. First,  the cups are incredible. I love them. I am considering it a collect them all game and will try to make damn sure I do. Second, the tea is delicious. I had two amazing cups.\\n\\nThe sushi isn't all that bad either. It could've been just me, but I found the selection of sushi a little limited and the specialty ones pretty overpriced, but the sushi I had was out of this world. I had the spicy scallop and the summertime soy paper roll. I seriously gobbled down that summertime roll fast and impressed many. \\n\\nI'll probably be back if I crave sushi at lunchtime again. However, I really get disappointed at the prices of the ones I would like to try (especially for lunch) and think I may run out of new dishes to try soon.   \n",

And the search for the best Thai establishment in the valley continues. \\n\\nAs usual, I was craving Thai tonight. Not that this is really a surprise. I wanted something decadent and full of flavor, spices, and heat. Due to talking I believe, we passed Thai Elephant which is what I intended to try and instead hit Thai Basil. \\n\\nI do have to give them props for having a seriously cute interior in a small plaza establishment. I was told that it's usually packed, which might've scared me considering how small it actually was. However tonight it was pretty slow. \\n\\nI ordered cashew chicken hot. The sticky rice was perfection and the cashew chicken was definitely hot. However, I didn't get all the flavor I have from other Thai places. I left wanting a little more in the way of flavor and spices. However, the dish was very fresh and healthy. \\n\\nI'll probably give it another try. Hoping it was just the dish I chose that was lacking spice and flavor.   \n",

The place is clean and the staff is nice. They stay on top of the bill and last time split checks with ease :)\\n\\nNo matter how packed the place gets they're always there to make sure your glass stays full. \\n\\nWhen I was DD, I was never charged for my soda or water.. or if I was, someone else put it on theirs.\\n\\nThe karaoke runs fairly smoothly, but the selection of songs is pretty lacking, at least for my taste.   \n",

We had a pretty big crowd and weren't made to feel out of place or like we were a bother. The place is decent sized and pretty laid back, which can be great on a Friday.\\n\\nI didn't order any food but it all looked fantastic. Had I been hungry I would've surely snatched up some of the wings. \\n\\nI was fairly impressed with the tap. I'm typically pretty picky about my beer selection and what is on tap, and I don't expect much from this type of establishment. However, after having a bad day and noticing they had Leinenkugels Sunset Wheat on tap, my day got brighter and I was happy. Anywhere that has Leinie's on tap gets brownie points in my book.\\n\\nI have to admit it struck me as odd that Nickelodeon was playing on one of the screens while I was there. I asked if we could have it switched and while they said yes, they never did.   \n",

When I arrived, I was a little worried as the over starched burgundy table decor and lack of patrons made me think of a stiff uncomfortable hotel restaurant.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and knowledgeable, and the menu looked fantastic with so-so prices. I ended up getting the primavera dish and stayed with water for my drink. The food was great, even down to the bread. I devoured it with pleasure! \\n\\nIn the end though, I don't think the patrons or staff were amused with the out of ordinary conversations my friends and I often like to have. The food was good enough that I won't write it off my list, but I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't welcome my kind any more haha!!   \n",

For a quick in and out Mexican place it's definitely worth it. The prices are decent, they have a fairly extensive menu, and the service is fast. \\n\\nThe downsides?\\n\\n1) Parking is very limited which caused me issues for the first time today.\\n2) Seating can sometimes be limited as well. It's a fairly small joint.\\n3) Being a non tomato fan and sometimes not being in the mood for guac doesn't leave me much of a choice here and my options are pretty plain and limited most of the time.\\n\\nWith that being said, it's definitely worth trying if you are in the area. I suggest the carne asada burrito :)   \n",

Unbelievable!\\n\\nLets just start with the salsa; the lovely, surprisingly dark addictive salsa. I recall at least 4 occasions where I inquired if it was available for take home purchase. Yay once again for non tomato based salsa!\\n\\nAdditionally I had a seafood enchilada that was TO. DIE. FOR. Honestly. It was just the right size for lunch and had salmon, halibut, shrimp, delicious cheese and was made with no tomato as requested. Topped with green Chile it had an amazing flavor that I ended up craving the rest of the day.\\n\\nEveryone in my group was completely satisfied. Even the meatloaf sandwich lunch special a coworker had looked delicious and I don't even really like meatloaf. \\n\\nThe service was kinda awkward, for lack of better words, but this completely made me feel better about this place. While it's a little out of the way, I can see it becoming a work lunch spot on occasion... and I won't complain and tell them about my horrid experience from before.   \n",

It weirds me out. So when I went in for a pedicure appointment with DeAnna and was hoping for some minx, which looks better on long toe nails, she was up front with me and let me do a custom glitter bling job instead. Not only did she mix up a glitter just for me (I'm sure the color isn't hard to guess), but she gave me the extra to use at home!!!\\n\\nGreat service and such an adorable place, Downtown Scottsdale Hair & Nails will definitely pamper you and make you feel at home!!   \n",

I haven't been disappointed yet. \\n\\nTheir drink menu is incredible. Lots of yummy items to choose from. I've seen great specials on wine and sangria. However, if you want a drink that is not on their special menu, it will be just as amazingly delicious but a little pricey. Their pom mojito is incredible and has agave and pomegranate. \\n\\nThe food is delicious, but nothing super spectacular. My dinner included a cup of their gumbo and the quesadilla. The gumbo wasn't the gumbo I was used to (it was a pretty runny rather than thicker) but it was good. The cup was so huge I wasn't able to finish it. I was able to order the quesadilla without tomato which always makes me happy. It was also delicious. I loved the combination of the spinach wrap and pine nuts and cheese. Mmm. \\n\\nThe place is a little awkward to get to and fairly small. On the upside though it does have cute decor once you are there.   \n",

Never have I sat inside, which is always an indicator to me that a place is worthy of repeat visits. Patios are in... indoors are out!\\n\\nThe selection is typical pub, and always has something I want, but I do always get sad face when a place doesn't carry ginger ale. Ginger ale is not only easy to make (and no, I'm not referring to the fake make it with coke way.. WTF is that?) but a fantastic mixer with all types of alcohol. \\n\\nIf you want a good place to socialize that's kinda crazy but not too crazy, this is a great choice!   \n",
       "836                                                    I can't tell you how heartbreaking it is that I cannot give The Lodge more stars than three.\\n\\nEspecially with how absolutely exited I was to go somewhere that had Bratwurst, Berry Weiss AND Cheese Curds. The midwestern girl in me was swooning for my knight in shining armor.\\n\\nThe berry weiss was amazing.... really wish it was on tap, but bottle will do. The cheese curds were sincerely authentic too. I introduced several at the table to their lusty flirtatious ways, and they will never be the same again.\\n\\nWhat ruined it you ask? The fact that it took us 40 minutes to pay our bill. When we received it, we realized we forgot to ask to split it and promptly asked the waitress. Her response?\\n\\n\"You should've asked me before you ordered and then I could have done it. However, we normally don't do it at all.\" \\n\\nWhat??? Um okay. We knew it wasn't all her fault and tried to split our bill. In the middle of our first attempt, she came by to ask if we were done and we said we needed a few more minutes. Well, come to third try of splitting a check 10 ways she comes back again and asks the same question. Frustrated, we tell her we are not, and she just shakes her head almost like she was angered at us and walks away.\\n\\nSeriously.. who doesn't split a check these days.. even after the fact. I've seen today's digital restaurant systems. This shouldn't have been an issue. Even if she had to void it and start over it wouldn't have taken her the 40 minutes it took us.. especially because there were only two other people in the entire place.\\n\\nUgh. Meh. That was not midwestern hospitality.   \n",

The British Open Pub or the BOP as I lovingly call it. This is a frequent lunchtime spot during the work week. Without knowing specifically where it was, you might drive right past it too. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is my favorite part of the BOP. It's usually a very relaxing place to be at lunch. I have never been there any other time, so I'm not sure if this always holds true. However, despite it typically being quiet at lunch, the service is usually pretty slow. I typically have to plan on a longer lunch than normal.\\n\\nThe beer selection is pretty good. I can always count on being able to have a Boddington's or a black velvet. As far as the food goes, it's pretty good, but not overly British and a little on the greasy side. \\n\\nI've noticed a few spelling errors on their menus from time to time too, which always annoys me.\\n\\nOverall the food isn't the best and the service is slow but it's still an okay place to visit.   \n",

Worth the trip.\\n\\nUnabridged: European Wax Center was recommended to me by my new stylist when I ended up falling in love with a hair salon that didn't do waxing. I have to admit that when I entered the location for the first time, I thought I was signing up for a cult. Just gave me one of those odd feelings. \\n\\nThat ended when I went back though and had my eyebrows waxed. It was the least painful waxing I've ever had. The room was clean, my waxer was nice and friendly. She made sure I wasn't allergic to anything. It was very pleasant and the price is super reasonable. \\n\\nAfter my first visit, I was told about a plan I could sign up for. I declined, but was told if I booked my next appointment in advance now, I'd get $5 off. What I wasn't told, was that there was a piece of paper or something I needed to have in order to redeem that, and when I returned a few weeks later, I wasn't given my discount. I was assured I will next time, but we'll see what happens. If the third time proves to have no discount attached, it may be enough for me to leave. I want to come back, but I also don't like being toyed with.   \n",

I'm not a big-box chain type person. However, I was in the area, starving, with some time to kill and was craving something to hold me over until dinner. \\n\\nWhat I had hoped for was a lemonade and a muffin. Only thing was, they didn't have lemonade. Boo. Mega mega boo.\\n\\nOnce I figured out where to go to order, I decided on a banana nut muffin and a black cherry smoothie. Speaking of which though, is it ever okay for a customer to not know where to go to order something? Really? I really hope no one thinks this is okay. Luckily, someone behind the counter sensed my frustration and helped me.\\n\\nThe prices weren't bad and everything was ready quickly and I was able to take a seat on a comfy chair in an area no one was occupying. The muffin was huge. Therefore, that combined with the smoothie rather than a lemonade meant I pretty much had my dinner there. Kinda sad. The muffin was fantastic but huge. The winner of this visit though? The black cherry smoothie. Now that I know how big portions are, whenever I need something to hold me over, I'll be back for that. Pure heaven.   \n",

It left an eh in my mind. Not a bad eh, which is usually a 2 for me, but more like an I'll-come-back-here-if-someone-else-is-dying-to eh, which leaves it at a 3.\\n\\nI can say that the cornbread is exquisite. It's what cornbread should be. Corn and bread. It's not cornmeal trying to be cornbread. It's not some yuppie metropolitan height of sophistication's chef trying to be country. It's the no shit real deal. I appreciate that. I just have to remember to appreciate it in small quantities.\\n\\nThe service was pretty on par for it being lunch on a Monday. \\n\\nMy main dish was the seafood enchilada which was pretty on point, but not as good as the one at Blue Adobe. I was pretty annoyed to see it came with tomato even though tomato was listed nowhere on the menu. I will remember that. I may just return and order cornbread with a side of cornbread.   \n",
